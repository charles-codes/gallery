# gallery
=========================

I am not much of a photographer, but I have been fortunate enough to spend some time outdoors in "The Last Best Place" of Montana, in particular, the Flathead Valley. 

This webpage is less of an opportunity to display my photographs and videos then a place to display an idea of web design for a photographer's portfolio. 

=========================

The quoted text is taken from T.S Eliot's "Little Gidding" in his Four Quartets and Tracy K. Smith's book of poetry Life on Mars. 

=========================

Gallery uses HTML, CSS, and some jQuery and Javascript to handle the flex gallery and the image modals within.
